# Please do not consider any of this seriously, it needs a lot of refinement

I follow this philosophy. GNU is better than Apache, BSD, MIT etc. licenses, since it forces the information to stay open source. Non profit is always better than for profit, since non-profits are organizations that focus on creating a positive impact on society, but this may not always be the case from the software development's speed, quality and intention POV. Anything related to software in logical cases should be on a spectrum and power efficiency should be by default, but performance when required.(But the spectrum doesn't allow for illogical things like uselessly performing stuff at unreasonable cases). UI/UX animations are a waste of resources unless for accessibility and debugging or for cases for the UI to not be suddenly acting, especially in cases like touchscreen movement via fingers. Being systemd/GNOME(or SoCs as in hardware) like and being 'complete and well integrated' is better than what openrc and Hyprland with waybar are, even though they are arguably better. Using modern protocols is better but they are not to be confused with 5GHz and 2.4Ghz which are just different bands on a spectrum  for frequency and not protocols(like IPv6>IPv4). Compatibility for the old protocols should be ditched out by default, but compatibility should be optional and retrievable via downloads. Why should we keep maintaining compatibility? Of course not in the first place, we should switch to modern solutions or force the legacy projects to be developed to be modern accordingly. According to me, developers should introduce 2 layers for releases only - "One should be Stable Station the next one is Feature Station. In Feature station, features are added and but there is no guarantee of developers putting out bug fixes here. In Stable station, Features are released only after bug testing and assestation of bugs not being present or be minimal." Binaries, shouldn't be compiled centrally, but the workload should be distributed onto DPCs(explained later) as well as the central machine and then released as a whole to the community, not compiled by each user individually for their use. And it should be obvious by now but just in case, you should heavily prioritize open source. Freedom is not always the answer, since Atomic releases are the future. They perform upgrades in an excellent manner, with fallback mechanisms. So, what is the purpose of an ISO? It is to install an OS that is meant to be USED by the user, not continually tweaked in the system files, this means that your OS is not up to the mark, or not optimized. Is tweaking system files your job, is it productivity? User control is judicially correct because it is indeed their computer, but having a dynamically working system is a smarter choice. Sure you have to install applications, but that's not what tweaking is. When Windows updates, it updates the system, only during reboots, but rpm-ostreed.service manages this well. Not only is your current session undisturbed(apart from a small resource footprint in the background), but your system is too, updated silently. Again on modern protocols, they have active development usually meaning that they have a better approach to development. Another problem, people keep forking stuff instead of contributing to the original project! Not only will contributing to upstream projects give you support from a wider user base, components will be well integrated too. If the main founder of Wayland was granted to have his considerations thought about, maybe in another universe, Xorg would have been popular. The exception being the original upstream project has maintainers with different motos/mindsets/goals. There are 2 types of users. "It just works" or "It just works, but better", and it is obviously more logical to be a part of the latter, unless you deliberately want a setup and go approach like Debian. A funny fact is that tons of solutions such as AngularJS and Spelt Runes have been developed, but still most websites use jQuery. Also, cloud computing should be the future. This is because if we move onto the cloud there would be several advantages. A central united computer would be present, where there is a base OS that is always automatically updated like Silverblue, there would be data stored for each user with the modifications working with/overlaying the base. Each consumer would be handed a designated device which is only meant to view/interact with the cloud session. When the consumer uses the cloud pc via their designated device, the base os on the server will not be affected whatsoever but what the user will use is the base os overlaying their data stored on the server. There could be times when the base os on the server would update, causing weekly outages but is probably worth it considering the supercomputer's integration and ease of use to operate from the end of the server operators and the consumers. If the consumer wants to pay less monthly, they would have to buy a DPC(theres no definite full form for this acronym), which would be plugged into the consumer's house or wherever they want. The DPC would help compute for the server operators/company in a distributed way, in exchange for less money required for using the cloud computer. The consumer cannot use the DPC as a regular PC and is only meant for remote task assignment/use from the end of the enterprise/hosting company. This could also be a dream come true for repository maintainers as the server's base os would indirectly help/add to all user sessions. Users as well as the operators would have to spend less time resolving issues and just publish changes universally. This can heavily uplift community involvement and increase productivity. Ofc this already exists, but not in this way. During software development, before proceeding to add new features, fix your bugs first prior to adding new features. The base system would include binaries of applications intended for productive usage. The computer should be used for productivity, not useless ricing and tweaking. Its inner workings should be tweaked by itself within.

Fedora Silverblue and GNOME indeed represent a progressive vision for Linux as a user-friendly, modern operating system. Here’s why they shine and how autonomous operation from tools like systemd could make the ecosystem even better:


---

1. Why Silverblue is Exceptional

Silverblue’s core philosophy aligns with what many users want: stability, immutability, and ease of use. Key features:

Immutable OS: The base system is read-only, reducing risks from misconfigurations and improving reliability.

OSTree for Updates: Updates are atomic and rollback-safe, ensuring users never break their system with an upgrade.

Seamless Container Support: Silverblue encourages containerized workflows with tools like Toolbox and Podman, making it great for developers and end-users.


This approach simplifies system management and increases user confidence, similar to macOS.


---

2. GNOME’s Contribution

GNOME is increasingly refined to focus on user experience:

Minimalism and Focus: GNOME emphasizes simplicity, avoiding cluttered interfaces and distractions.

Wayland Integration: GNOME’s commitment to Wayland ensures smoother graphics and better security compared to X11.

First-Class Flatpak Support: GNOME Software integrates Flatpak for easy installation of sandboxed, cross-distro apps, which aligns with Silverblue’s immutability.


When paired with Silverblue, GNOME provides a cohesive, polished desktop experience.


---

3. Systemd’s Potential for Autonomy

Systemd already manages much of the system autonomously:

Service Management: Automatically starts and restarts critical services.

Timers: Replaces cron jobs with easier-to-use, flexible scheduling.

Device and Power Management: Seamlessly integrates with hardware for suspend, hibernate, and resource control.


However, its full potential lies in:

User-Friendly Extensions: Abstracting complex configurations for the average user while retaining power for advanced users.

Self-Healing Systems: Automatic diagnostics and recovery from failures without manual intervention.

Predictable Boot Behavior: Combined with Silverblue's immutability, this can result in a nearly foolproof system.

4. Improvements to Push Silverblue and GNOME Further


1. Autonomous Configuration: Imagine Silverblue pre-configured to handle hardware detection and system settings via systemd autonomously, removing the need for user tweaks.

2. Better Onboarding: Interactive tutorials on GNOME or Silverblue could guide users through key concepts like OSTree and Toolbox.

3. Third-Party App Ecosystem: Strengthening Flatpak adoption among developers to rival macOS App Store's seamless experience.

Why Silverblue & GNOME Represent Linux’s Future

Silverblue’s immutable, modular approach paired with GNOME’s user-first design shows how Linux can evolve for mainstream use. Autonomous tools like systemd, if further enhanced, can eliminate common Linux pain points and create a system that "just works" without sacrificing flexibility.

It’s a promising direction for bridging the gap between Linux enthusiasts and everyday users.

And I am here to try fixing it in the back end.

The below, I wrote a long time ago, but now I laugh at:

Alright I have made the decision to go back to Windows from a 4 year Linux user. I learnt a lot about it and I feel satisfied.
Despite the security that Silverblue/Bazzite provides or the ability to use it however you want to is there, I am going back.
Linux was made in mind as a hobby project and a general purpose free software kernel, not meant(this is an important word) for users, but works surprisingly well.
The lack of some drivers makes it unsuitable for my AL/ML training needs as well as ROCm support for HPC. Fare well to the Linux Foundation and the community.
I will indeed keep a copy of the OS on a type 1 hypervisor on Windows, so that I can keep developing from it. For some, privacy matters a lot, but for me, the experience does.
The seamlessness of some proprietary services is unmatched as compared to that of open source solutions, due to the intentions of the suppressment made by some of the mafias of capitalism of big tech. Ads in Windows? I think they need a fair share for making one of the best consumer operating systems. They can be useful at times. Some people think about privacy or freedom to fork into their own self declared project when they see open source, I think about freelanced development, verifiability of the source of a program, accelerated speed of development. Copilot is AI slop? No, I believe in its use for great assistance and productivity, even if the user interface is not customizable. I believe it is not proprietary vs OSS,
but the power of the best of both worlds that can be acheived with a hybrid model. Lets see what Bruce Perens, The founder of the OSD has to offer in his post open model.
